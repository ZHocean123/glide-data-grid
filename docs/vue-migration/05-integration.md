# Phase 5 – Integration, Hardening & Release

## Desired Outcomes
- Validate the Vue packages across real-world scenarios, ensuring parity with the React ecosystem and stabilising for public release.
- Finalise documentation, release processes, and marketing collateral for the Vue offerings.
- Establish long-term maintenance workflows (testing, changelog updates, release automation).

## Prerequisites
- Core, cells, and source Vue packages functionally complete with passing test suites and Storybook coverage.
- Open issues from earlier phases triaged with mitigation plans.
- Stakeholders aligned on release timeline, versioning, and communication plan.

## Task Breakdown

### 5.1 Cross-Framework Regression Testing
- Run combined regression matrix executing React and Vue Storybook visual tests and Playwright smoke suites.
- Execute `npm run build`, `npm run test`, `npm run test-vue`, `npm run lint --workspaces`, and targeted end-to-end scenarios.
- Validate tree-shaking and bundle sizes for Vue packages using `npm pack` + `webpack-bundle-analyzer` or Vite inspect.

### 5.2 Documentation & Marketing
- Update root README with Vue installation/usage instructions and compatibility table.
- Refresh `docs/` site (Typedoc, guides) with Vue sections; ensure navigation highlights both frameworks.
- Coordinate with marketing to produce announcement blog, changelog entries, and example screenshots/gifs.

### 5.3 Release Engineering
- Prepare changelog entries (`CHANGELOG.md`) for `packages/core-vue`, `packages/cells-vue`, `packages/source-vue`.
- Update release scripts/GitHub Actions to publish Vue packages with appropriate npm tags (`next`, `latest` upon GA).
- Perform dry-run publish (`npm publish --dry-run`) to verify bundles, typings, and metadata correctness.

### 5.4 Support & Maintenance Plan
- Define issue templates/labels distinguishing Vue vs React bugs.
- Schedule post-release monitoring (error telemetry, support backlog review).
- Document ongoing compatibility strategy (keeping shared modules in sync, aligning feature releases).

## Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria
- Signed-off regression report comparing React and Vue critical paths.
- Updated documentation site and README sections demonstrating Vue usage.
- Published release notes and npm packages for all Vue workspaces (even if tagged as beta).
- Maintenance plan archived in `docs/vue-migration/maintenance.md` or team wiki.

## Collaboration & Review
- Engage QA, support, and product marketing to review final release artefacts.
- Coordinate with DevOps for CI/CD updates and monitoring hooks.
- Plan community feedback loop (beta customers, GitHub discussions) post-release.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Release regression** due to incomplete coverage → Automate cross-framework smoke tests and require green CI before publish.
- **Documentation inconsistencies** → Institute content review checklist and pair writing sessions across teams.
- **Support burden spike** → Stage rollout via beta channel, add usage analytics/feedback form.
- **Version drift** between React and Vue packages → Establish shared release cadence and automation to sync changelog/version bumps.
